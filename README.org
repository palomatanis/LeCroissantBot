This bot's purpose is to help people getting organized when buying large groups of croissants. If you want to use it for this same purpose (or tweak it and use it for other delicious foods), these are the basic steps:

* How did this bot come to life?
I happen to live in a beautiful neighbourhood, and next to my house,
there is a Bakery. Not just any bakery. We are talking about a place
where you can buy the best Croissants in the world.\\
 You may not believe this, but it's only because you have not tried
these beautiful, buttery, golden, delicious Croissants.\\
 Very aware of the magical properties of this pastry, I once gave some
to my friends who had come to my house in order to study for an
important test, as they were in urgent need of some happiness.\\
Of course, they were flabbergasted upon tating them, and soon after I
was hearing from all my friends and acquaintances, all wanting to
enjoy the same experience.\\
I started bringing Croissants to university in the morning a couple
times a week. I would ask via Telegram in a group or two and tried to
keep up with each person who wanted a Croissant. Soon this proved to
be a rather unpleasant task, and I would often find that I had
forgotten someone. As this was unacceptable, I decided to solve this
by creating a bot dedicated to this task.

* How does the bot work?
On one side, each person who is interested in getting a Croissant from
me occasionaly, can receive Croissant updates by subscribing to the
list in the bot:
: \start
: \subscribe
When decide I'm going to go to the Bakery, I (or any admin in
providers.db) just have to:
: \croissants
After this, each subscriber will receive a message asking if they
would like to receive a Croissant in university that morning, to which
they can answer yes, 1 croissant, or 2, or none (which is rare).
As soon as I decide to go and buy the Croissants, I (or an admin) do
: \bought 
Which will alert each addict (erm, sorry, person) who accepted the
offer that croissants are on their way, and those who haven't answered
are notified that it is now too late for them to do so.
Apart from that, it is possible to unsubscribe from the list
: \unsubscribe

There is also a command to see the top buyers of Croissants of all
times by just
: \history

And of course the opening hours of the Bakery
: \opening



* Before being able to run this bot, you will have to
** Install

- Python3
- Sqlite
- pip 3

** Install the API

: $ git clone https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI.git
: $ cd pyTelegramBotApi
: $ python3 setup.py install

** Have a token 

Or get it from @BotFather

** Feel the love for the Croissants!!
(this is the most important step)

* In order to run it

Clone this repo

: git clone https://github.com/palomatanis/LeCroissantBot.git

Put the bot's admin(s) telegram ID in data/providers.db
Go to the folder you cloned, then:

: ./run.sh

And voil√°!

(You have to be able to sync with gitHub via ssh)

The script will pull from your repo before running the bot. This way,
if you want to change some code, you just need to push the changes to
your repo, do =/reset= from the bot in telegram (if you are an admin).
This will kill the bot, and the script will pull from git before
running the bot again!

It will pull and then run the bot each time the bot dies.

* And clean the databases! 
Get your own suscriptors :D
(mine only want my Croissants and are not interested in any other form of alimentation)
