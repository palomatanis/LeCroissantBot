This bot's purpose is to help people getting organized when buying large groups of croissants.

* Before running it you need

** Install

- Python3
- pip 3

** Install the API

: $ git clone https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI.git
: $ cd pyTelegramBotApi
: $ python3 setup.py install

** Have a token!! 

If you don't, get it form @BotFather


** Feel the love for the Croissants!!
(this is the most important step)


* In order to run it

Just open a terminal, go to this folder and:

: ./run.sh

And voilá!!!

It will run the python script and rerun it if it dies.
When it does this, it will pull form your repo. This way, if you want to change something if the bot, you just need to do = /reset = from telegram (if you are an admin (see bot.py). This will kill the bot, and the script with run it again, pulling from git before executing the python script!
